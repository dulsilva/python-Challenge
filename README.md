# python-Challenge
resources for my main.py file in PyBank include Stack Overflow and youtube videos helping me fix some of the issues in my code such as file writing my results into the analysis folder. 
I had issues figuring out the results for main.py in PayPoll. I asked a learning assistant and they could not help me with my issue. Learning Assistant said my code looked good but did not understand why VS Code could not set the path for my election_data.csv. Thatis why results are pissing from my Pypoll.
I understand my homework is turned in late but I am struggling to understand the concepts so I decided to take longer to work on the homework and actually understand the concept instead of turning in something I did not understand and is mostly incomplete.
